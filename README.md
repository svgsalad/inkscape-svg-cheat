====================

This repository contains cheat sheets for Inkscape users. The cheat sheets were
originally made as SVGs in Inkscape. They were then exported to PNGs and PDFs.

Inkscape is a professional vector graphics drawing tool. What especially nice
is that Inkscape is libre & open-source software, and it is usually used by
free software lovers, like the people at The Fedora Project or, maybe you!
