# index file
#
# This file is read by chshlistgen.sh to generate a Markdown table of available
# cheat sheets. It contains metadata of every cheat sheet to be listed in the
# table.
#
# Entries:
#   #: Comment (which will be ignored)
#   F: Cheat sheet's file name (excluding the file extension)
#   T: Title
#   A: Author
#   D: Description
#   C: Contributors (names are separated by a comma)
#   L: License (full name)
#   L (second entry): License's copy's file name (in LICENSES/)
#
# The entries should be written in the exact same order as presented above.
# The only required entry is F (cheat sheet's file name). Without it, other
# entries of the cheat sheet will be ignored, and the cheat sheet won't appear
# in the output table.
#
# Metadata entries belonging to the same cheat sheet must be written close
# together (with no empty line break). Groups of entries belonging to different
# cheat sheets must be separated by at least one empty line.
